   If every angel's terrible

   Then why do you welcome them ...

If every angel's terrible
Then why do you welcome them, you said
you'd provide the birdbath, if
I provide the skin
 
And bathing in the moonlight
I'm to tremble like a kitten
...

If blue eyed babes
Raised as Hitler's little brides and sons
They got angelic tendencies
Like some boys tend to act like queens
 
Oh, if every angel's terrible
Then why do you watch her sleep
You love to hear her sing
And wear purple eyes like rings
 
Well, the flowers have no scent
And the child's been miscarried
...

Oh, every angel's terrible
Said Freud and Rilke all the same
Rimbaud never paid them no mind
But Jimmi Morrison had his elevators
 
...His elevators
He had his elevator angels...
 
And, if every angels terrible
Why do you hide inside her
Like a child in a skirt
The supermarket's loud and bright
 
And boy, don't she feel warm tonight
Boy, don't she feel warm tonight
...
 
Boy, don't she feel warm tonight
(..she's so pregnant...she...)

If every angel's terrible
Then why do you welcome them, you said
you'd provide the birdbath
If I provide the skin
 
She's so little like an angel
when she cryes (she cries)
